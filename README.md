# CHAD-software
all the software and firmware for CHAD(my humanoid robot)

For both voice command and face recognition to work simultaneously, run one file in one IDE and the other file in the other IDE. I used vs code and python IDLE.
the database for the chatbot is in database.json. make sure it is in the same folder as main.py
